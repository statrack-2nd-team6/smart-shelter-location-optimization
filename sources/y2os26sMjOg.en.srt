1
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:16,736
Oh

2
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:24,438
Oh baby

3
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:44,636
When I'm completely lost in your eyes

4
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,366
I feel like I've got the whole world, yeah

5
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:55,542
In this overwhelming excitement, I dream again

6
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:57,886
An endless dream called you

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,983
The precious feeling called love

8
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:04,714
Without you, I wouldn't know

9
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:07,824
It's just a fleeting emotion

10
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,110
You awaken me

11
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:14,001
You always make my heart race anew, you're mine

12
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:16,623
You're the only answer for me

13
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:21,146
Even if eternity doesn't exist, yeah

14
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:24,693
I won't believe it

15
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:29,587
Baby, just like the first feeling, always love me more

16
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:34,104
Even as time passes, I'm still yours

17
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:38,631
Oh baby, like an unending dream, love me more

18
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:43,107

The world I faced, blossomed because of you

27
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:11,556
Do you know how much your love has illuminated me?

28
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:15,536
This moment is complete because you're here

29
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:20,375
I want to whisper to you too

30
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:25,035
